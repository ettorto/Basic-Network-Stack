## Introduction:
This documentation presents an overview of a modular network stack designed for efficient packet handling, encompassing applications, devices, handlers, and protocol implementations. Each component plays a crucial role in enabling communication over various network layers.

## Components

### 1. Applications (`apps`):
Applications represent the user-facing interface of the network stack, providing interaction points for data transmission and reception.

- `udp_app.c`: Implements User Datagram Protocol (UDP) application functionality. UDP offers a lightweight, connectionless communication method suitable for applications prioritizing speed and simplicity.
- `tcp_app.c`: Manages Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) application functionalities. TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, ideal for applications requiring guaranteed delivery and sequencing.

### 2. Devices (`device`):
Devices represent the physical or virtual interfaces through which network communication occurs.
- `tap.c`: Represents a TUN/TAP virtual network device. This device is crucial for testing and debugging network applications without external network dependencies. TUN/TAP interfaces provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for network stack implementation. They enable the interception and analysis of network traffic at the data link layer, facilitating tasks such as packet filtering, monitoring, and debugging. TUN interfaces are used for IP packet routing, while TAP interfaces are used for Ethernet packet interception. These interfaces play a vital role in the development and maintenance of network applications, providing a versatile toolset for network stack implementation.

### 3. Handlers (`handler`):
Handlers manage various aspects of packet processing and system-level interactions within the network stack.

- `interrupt.c`: Handles interrupt processing, crucial for handling asynchronous events such as incoming packet notifications or hardware interrupts efficiently.
- `pcap.c`: Facilitates Packet Capture (PCAP) functionality, enabling the capture, analysis, and transmission of network packets. PCAP is vital for network monitoring and diagnostic purposes.
- `synchronize.c`: Manages synchronization mechanisms necessary for coordinating access to shared resources in multi-threaded networking environments.
- `tap.c`: Implements the functionality of a TAP (Network Tap) device, allowing packet interception and analysis at the data link layer.

### 4. Protocols (`src`):
Protocols represent the fundamental rules and conventions for communication within a network.

- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** (`arp.c`): Responsible for resolving network layer addresses into link layer addresses. ARP is essential for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses in Ethernet networks.
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** (`icmp.c`): Provides control and error messaging functionality. ICMP is commonly used for diagnostic purposes, such as ping requests and responses.
- **Internet Protocol (IP)** (`ip.c`): Implements the Internet Protocol for packet routing. IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets across network boundaries.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** (`udp.c`): Implements the User Datagram Protocol, a simple, connectionless transport layer protocol suitable for applications that do not require reliable communication.

### Devices:
Devices represent various interfaces or endpoints within the network stack.

- **Ethernet Tap** (`ethertap.c`): Represents a virtual Ethernet interface. Ethertap devices are used for intercepting and analyzing Ethernet traffic at the data link layer.

## Network Stack Architecture:

- The network stack follows a modular architecture, allowing for flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- Each component is designed to perform a specific function, promoting modularity and reusability.
- Communication between components is facilitated through well-defined interfaces, enabling seamless interaction and integration.
- The stack leverages both user-space and kernel-space functionalities, providing a balance between performance and flexibility.

## Utilization:

- The choice of protocols and devices reflects the stack's versatility and suitability for diverse networking scenarios.
- UDP and TCP applications cater to different application requirements, offering options for both connectionless and connection-oriented communication.
- Devices like the loopback interface and Ethernet Tap facilitate testing, debugging, and monitoring of network traffic, enhancing the development and maintenance experience.
- Handlers such as interrupt management and synchronization ensure efficient and reliable operation of the network stack, particularly in multi-threaded environments.
